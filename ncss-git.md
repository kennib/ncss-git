# Version Control
## What exactly is version control?
Version control is simply a way to track your files as they change. 

At its core it's really not that complicated at all.
You may have even created a very simple version of it yourself.
Something like this:

  * ~Essay FINAL really final this time.doc
  * Essay.doc
  * Essay (final draft).doc
  * Essay FINAL.doc
  * Essay FINAL1.doc
  * Essay FINAL countdown.doc
  * Essay (first draft).doc
  * Essay (first draft) 1.doc

## Why use a version control tool?
There are many problems that will appear with a solution like the above one.
What is the file we're currently working on?
How do we find that sentence about the effect of the plutocracy on bourgeois society? Was it in "Essay FINAL.doc" or "Essay.doc"?
What if we just want to change back to the version of the essay we had at the start of the day? What if we've already saved over that version?
What if we need to collaborate with someone on our essay? Do we have to manual go through and find all the changes we both made and merge them together?

We could of course come up with increasingly more consistent and complicated schemes for naming and storing our files.
At some point though we should probably ask ourselves if someone has already made a tool for helping us do this.
The answer is of course yes! There are many different version control systems available.
At NCSS we will be using git <http://git-scm.com/>
