# NCSS git

This is an instruction manual on how to use git.
The intent is to primarily to teach about how to use the git GUI [Github for Windows](http://windows.github.com/) to make it easy for the newer students.
However, where it is not too complicated we should add code samples for the command line interface in parallel to screenshots.

It is written in Markdown. You can use a tool like [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) to compile it into a PDF or webpage.

Pandoc command to generate a pdf
```
pandoc ncss-git.md -o ncss-git.pdf
```
